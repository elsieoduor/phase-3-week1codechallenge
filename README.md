# Coding Challenges

Welcome to the "Coding Challenges" project! This repository contains solutions to three coding challenges that involve various tasks related to string manipulation, conditional statements, and time conversion. Each challenge is designed to test different aspects of your programming skills.

## Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

**Task:**
Converting a 12-hour time format to a 24-hour time format can be tricky. This challenge requires you to implement a function that takes an hour (ranging from 1 to 12), a minute (ranging from 0 to 59), and a period ("am" or "pm") as input. Your task is to return a four-digit string representing the input time in 24-hour format.

## Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive

**Task:**
In this challenge, you need to write a function that takes three integers as input arguments. The function should return `True` if exactly two out of the three integers are positive (greater than zero). Otherwise, it should return `False`.

## Challenge 3: Consonant value

**Task:**
This challenge involves working with strings and assigning values to consonants. Given a lowercase string consisting of alphabetic characters only (no spaces), you need to find and return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou". Each consonant is assigned a value from 'a' = 1 to 'z' = 26.

## How to Use

Each challenge has its own function implemented in the provided code. To test the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Open the respective challenge's file (Constant.py, Numbers.py, or Time.py).
2. Navigate to the function corresponding to the challenge.
3. Modify the provided test inputs or add your own.
4. Run the script in your preferred JavaScript environment (Node.js, browser console, etc.).
5. Observe the output to verify the correctness of the solution.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and improve the solutions. You can also use these challenges as practice to enhance your programming skills.

## Contribution
